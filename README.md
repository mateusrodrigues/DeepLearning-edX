# DAT236x - Deep Learning Explained

This is my follow-along code to [DAT236x](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-explained-microsoft-dat236x) at edx.org as a make my way through the course. This is built on top of the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) and written in Python.

The projects are organized in folders, each referring to a lab. Each course module contains a lab by the end of it.

## To open this project

1. Download Visual Studio 2017
2. During installation, make sure to tick the Python workload option, so that the Python tooling for Visual Studio is installed as well
3. Follow the [CNTK tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/setup-cntk-on-your-machine) on how to get the Python library installed. I personally decided to go with Anaconda for Python environments, CNTK 2.1 and Python 3.5
4. Open the *DeepLearning-edX.sln* file and all projects should be loaded automatically
